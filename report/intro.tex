Building a radio map is often important for understanding 
the coverage area. Geostatistical tools such as Kriging, 
in turn, are useful for estimating the values at unknown 
locations. In this short report, we present the results 
for the interpolation of WiFi signal using Ordinary Kriging. 
We first present the basic mathematics behind the Simple 
Kriging and then show the results for the 
interpolation of real data.
